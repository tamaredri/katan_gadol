It is a website to perpetuate the holocast in an easy way for the Z-generation.

for now - the website can only recieve 2 .mp4 files, that has the same video frame size,
and concatnate them into 1 video file.

* using the NReco Nugget package for video editing (a wrapper for ffmpeg)
* the folder locations are a root path.
in order to run on another computer - you need to change the path strings in these files:
	-KatanGadolWeb\KatanGadolWeb\uploadePage.aspx.cs
	-KatanGadolWeb\ConcatnateVideo\ConcatnateVideo.cs

the naxt stage in this project is to add more functionalities to the website
and editing possibilities for the new video.

meaning: creating video editing libraries
